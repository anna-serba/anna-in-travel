## Weather

Starting with the dry season, which runs from November to April, this is considered the peak tourist season in Phuket. The weather during this time is characterized by clear blue skies, low humidity, and warm temperatures. It's the perfect time to soak up the sun, go snorkeling or diving, and explore the island's many attractions.

Next, we have the wet season, which lasts from May to October. During this time, Phuket experiences heavy rainfall and occasional thunderstorms. While the weather may be unpredictable, the island's lush greenery comes to life, creating a picturesque backdrop for nature lovers. It's also worth noting that hotel rates and tourist crowds are significantly lower during this season.
